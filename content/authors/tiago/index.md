Tiago Cortinhal holds a PhD in Computer Vision from Halmstad University, where his doctoral work focused on semantics-aware multi-modal domain translation and sensor fusion. He is a postdoctoral researcher at CiTIUS (Centro Singular de Investigación en Tecnoloxías Intelixentes), Universidade de Santiago de Compostela, and in this role applies multi-modal perception to healthcare by combining imaging data and clinical information to build richer, more reliable representations.
